# My Account

## How do I change my forum username?
In order to change your username, you need to contact Curse support. More information on how to do this is outlined [here](http://support.curse.com/hc/en-us/articles/204270285-How-do-I-change-my-Curse-Account-name-). You only get one username change, though.

#### Q: How do I change my avatar?
**A:** You can change your avatar by visiting [this](http://www.minecraftforum.net/account/avatars) link or hovering over your name in the top right corner of the webpage and selecting "Change Avatar" ([reference]()). There is no minimum size for an avatar, but ideally, they're the same width and height. The dimensions for an avatar are 140x140 pixels.

#### Q: Can I upload an animated avatar?
**A:** Yes, you can. However, they must go though a process before they are animated on the site. As such, they might show as static images for a short amount of time. Your avatar must be 100x100 pixels or less to be animated. 

## How do I change my signature?
You can edit your signature by visiting [this](http://www.minecraftforum.net/account/profile) link. Scroll down a bit until you see "Signature" and start editing. There are no limits to your signature.

## What's this text under my username? What are post ranks? Can I change it?
This is your title (or post rank). The more posts you get, the more titles you unlock. They are purely visual and have no effect on your account. You can change what is being displayed at any time in your settings [right here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/account/titles). You cannot create your own title.

## Why doesn't my post count increase?
Some sections, such as Forum Games and Forum Roleplaying, do not increase your post count as they are purely for fun and don't create any valuable discussion. For instance, threads like "Count to x until y happens" could be used to "farm" forum posts if the post count would increase.

## What are "thanks"? How do I earn them?
"Thanks" are a way of showing that forum members like your posts. They are obtained when someone clicks [this]() green arrow in the bottom left of your post. The number next to it shows how many thanks the member has received for this specific post. If you like someones content, feel free to give them a thanks to show them your support!

## I want my account deleted, or all of my posts deleted. How do I do that?
You can contact Curse support [here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/meta/support) or, if you want your account deleted, you can find more info [here](http://support.curse.com/hc/en-us/articles/207676876-How-do-I-delete-my-Minecraft-Forums-account-).

# Forum Posting

## How can I change the title or prefixes of a thread I've already created?
Navigate to the thread you would like to change and look for the green button named "Tools" located in the upper right area of your thread. Hover over this button and look for the "Edit Thread" option. Upon clicking this, you will see two different options, prefix and title. To edit the title of your thread, just edit the text box to your liking. To change prefixes, you can either click the x's on existing prefixes to remove them, or click on the box to bring up a full list of prefixes available to add. When you're done making all your changes, you can click the "Edit Thread" button in the bottom right to save your changes and return to your thread.

## How do I post an image or screenshot?
You can embed images into your posts by clicking the "Insert/edit image" button in the post editor. If you already have a link to the image you want to embed in your post, just put it in the source option and then press OK. The description and dimensions options are optional. If you don't already have a link to the image and have it on your computer instead, you'll need to upload it somewhere. We recommend that you use [Imgur](https://imgur.com/), a popular, reliable and free image hosting service. Click the upload images button at the top, and then either select the image from your computer or drag and drop it on the page, then click start upload. Once it's done, you'll need to get the direct link to the image. In most browsers, you can right click the image and there will be an option to either open image in a new tab or open the direct image. Click this and copy the URL of the image, you can now put this URL in the source option and click OK to insert the image into your post.

## How do I post a video?
For the most part, you shouldn't have to worry about this. The forum will automatically convert any YouTube links posted on the forum into an embeded video. If for some reason that doesn't work, you can use the [media] BBCode tag. An example of using this tag would be like this, [media]YouTube link here[/media].

## How do I make spoilers?
You can make a spoiler in your post by clicking the "Insert a spoiler" button in the post editor, you can find it by looking for the exclamation mark. If you click the button with no text selected, it will make a blank spoiler for you to type in. If you had text highlighted when you click the spoiler button, the editor will put the text you had highlighted into the spoiler for you.

## I have a very long post and want to organize it with a few links. How do I make a link that takes me elsewhere in the same post?
You can use a cool feature called anchors. Anchors allow you to have clickable text that will bring you somewhere else on a post. Most commonly, this will be used for making table of contents on long posts for easier navigation. Anchors use 2 BBCode tags, [goto] and [anchor]. The [goto] tag is the tag you use to link to an existing anchor. An example of using [goto] would be as follows, [goto='Introduction']The Introduction[/goto]. Using this would create clickable text "The Introduction" linking to an anchor named Introduction. Creating an anchor to link to is just as easy. Make sure that you put this anchor wherever you want the [goto] tag linking people to. If we are to name it Introduction, the anchor would be [anchor='Introduction'][/anchor]. Once we've done all that, the clickable "The Introduction" text should now be linking to wherever you put the Introduction anchor at.

## How do I delete my own post or thread?
You can report your thread or post with the report reason "Move/Delete My Post". A moderator will then remove it for you. Please note that if you would like all your posts deleted, you should contact Curse support [here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/meta/support) instead.

# General

## Where do I find the forum rules?
General forum rules, that apply to each section, are found [here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/meta/rules).
The forum rules for each section can be found at that link too, or at the top of each forum page. For instance, if I want to find the rules for Mapping & Modding, I can visit any (sub-)section of Mapping & Modding and click [this](http://i.imgur.com/Yg0jDNK.png) link at the top.

## How do Forum Notifications work?
When you have subscribed to a thread, you [receive a notification at the top left](http://i.imgur.com/WxnB3wC.png) for the latest comment that was posted in that thread. The number shows how many notifications you received since your last visit. When clicking on that icon, you see a dropdown with all notifications received. When clicking on "See All Notifications" at the bottom, you can see all notifications you got from a thread. These notifications are sorted by date and hierarchically structured, indented ones being from the same thread as the less indented one above.

## How do I report content?
If you see a member breaking forum rules, you can use the [report button at the bottom](http://i.imgur.com/83Ll8US.png) of the rule infringing post and select the appropriate reason from the dropdown menu. A moderator will get to the report as soon as possible.

## How/Where can I receive support?
You can request and receive support from [this page](http://www.minecraftforum.net/meta/support).

## I need help with my Minecraft/Mojang account! Help me?
Unfortunately, there's not much we can do for you there! You'll have to contact the [Mojang Support Team](https://help.mojang.com/customer/portal/emails/new?ref=footer). 

## Minecraft isn't working properly, can you help?
We sure can! You can post a thread in the [Support Forum](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/support) and someone will be able to help you with your problem. Make sure you're as detailed as you can though.

## How can I support the forums?
Just being here is supporting us! However, if you'd like to support us even more, you can get [Curse Premium](https://mods.curse.com/premium/legacy) which gives you a fancy title, removes ads, and gives you so much more!. 

## I saw an autoplay ad and it's very annoying. Is there anything I can do about that?
Auto playing advertisments are actually against Curse's advertising policy! However, sometimes they slip in. If you can, get as much information as you can (Screenshots, location of ad, type of ad, etc.) you can send an email to <support@minecraftforum.net> and it will be removed as soon as possible.

## What's the fancy thing under my avatar?
The text under your title is your member title! You unlock more member titles the more you post. You can read the list of member titles [here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/forums/forum-discussion-info/517685-current-member-title-list).

## Who are the forum staff members?
The forum staff members are a group of volunteers who dedicate their time to ensure the forum is safe and family friendly. You can see who is a part of the staff by looking at the [staff list](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/forums/forum-discussion-info/517684-staff-list).

**A:** If you're not sure, you can go ahead and respond to the warning message and ask the moderator why. They'd be more than happy to tell you why you got the warning.

#### Q: I don't believe the warning I got was fair! What can I do?
**A:** If you'd like to appeal your warning, go to your profile and click "Warning & Bans". Then, click on "Appeal". Please note: The staff member processing your appeal will not be the staff member who issued you the warning.

#### Q: Does my post break the rules?
**A:** If you aren't sure if your post follows the rules, you can [contact a staff member of that section](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/forums/forum-discussion-info/517684-staff-list) and they'd be more than happy to help you. Don't worry, you won't get a warning for asking.
