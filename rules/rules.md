<h1>Minecraft Forum Rules</h1>

Above all else Minecraft Forum serves to provide a safe, secure and family friendly environment for Minecraft fans of all ages to share and enhance their love for Minecraft, through news, videos, downloadable content and discussion. A constructive, respectful and welcoming approach is required from all members at all times, in both public posts and private conversations.

The forum rules are a combination of behaviour guidelines and concrete rules, each forum rule includes an explanation of the rule and information on the action that should be taken by moderators. Moderators operate in line with our Moderator Guidelines and can make decisions independent of the rules listed here.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the rules please [Contact Us](http://www.minecraftforum.net/about/support). Thank you!

# Behaviour Guidelines

* __Be nice and polite__, every member deserves to be treated with respect. Positive and polite posts create a friendly and welcoming environment that all members will feel comfortable in.

* __Think before posting__, sensible, well thought-out and legible posts help other members understand what is being communicated and encourage better discussion.

* __Post in relevant sections__, this will ensure that each thread is seen by members most interested in the subject.

* __Remain on topic__, a new thread should be created for any significant deviation from the topic of the opening post.

* __Report rule violations__, to staff members for review, any content that needs moderator attention should be reported.

* __Abide by developers terms of service__, Minecraft is available on a variety of platforms authored by a variety of developers, each platform and developer has their own Terms of Service and Minecraft Forum members are required to abide by these at all times. This includes the [Mojang EULA](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula), [Xbox Terms Of Use](http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/Legal/LiveTOU), Sony [PlayStation 4](http://www.scei.co.jp/ps4-eula/), [PlayStation 3](http://www.scei.co.jp/ps3-eula/) and [PlayStation Vita](http://www.scei.co.jp/psvita-eula/) Terms of Service, [iTunes Store Terms and Conditions](http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html) and the [Google Play Terms of Service](https://play.google.com/about/play-terms.html).

* __Do not use profanity or post inappropriate content__, as a family friendly forum we require that all content is suitable for people of all ages, this includes words, videos and pictures. Any posts containing inappropriate content or profanity (including self censored, automatically censored, acronyms and slang) will be removed from the forum.

* __Do not behave in a malicious or disruptive manner__, behaviour that can cause distress, harm or inconvenience to other members, staff or the forum itself is not allowed. This includes, but is not limited to, discrimination, bullying, offensive material, using multiple forum accounts, breaching others privacy and accessing others accounts without permission.

# Global Rules

The Minecraft Forum Global Rules apply to each section of the website, including the Forum, Private Messages, Profile Comments, Article Comments and Server Comments. 

## Advertising

Promoting something on the forum is advertising, advertising includes Minecraft related things, like YouTube videos, servers and development services, and includes non-Minecraft things, like Kickstarter projects, games and surveys. Advertising on the forum is only permitted if a relevant forum section exists for the content that is to be advertised, for example advertising Minecraft Servers is permitted in the [Minecraft Servers](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/servers) section, and advertising Minecraft based YouTube videos is permitted in the [Show Your Creation](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/show-your-creation) section. Any advertising that does not fit into a section is not allowed unless an administrator has provided permission, please [Contact Us](http://www.minecraftforum.net/about/support) to obtain permission.

> Moderators should move advertising to the correct section where possible, otherwise a warning for Advertising should be issued and the post should be deleted. Members who repeatedly advertise after warnings, either in the wrong section or advertising that isn't permitted, should be submitted for Member Administrative Review.

## Bumping

Posting in a thread with the sole intention of bringing the thread back to the top of the section without providing any additional content to the thread is bumping. The forum does not permit bumping because it benefits the thread author at the expense of other forum users by giving the impression that there is a new content in the thread and pushing threads with new content further down the list.

The most common form that bumping takes is a post containing just the word "bump", however some members are more sophisticated and may bump with posts tangentially related to the subject but without value. For example in Servers more sophisticated bumping can take the form of "We're still looking for players!" or "There are 10 people online". The easiest way to differentiate a bump from a legitimate post is to consider whether or not the post provides any value for visitors to the thread, both new and returning.

> Moderators should delete bumping posts and issue a Bumping warning. A Member Administrative Review should be created if a member has been warned multiple times for bumping or if they've bumped a single thread a substantial amount -- more than 20 posts.

## Flaming

Any rude, insulting or upsetting behaviour towards another member is flaming, and any disrespectful behaviour that can be seen to encourage rude, insulting or upsetting responses is flame baiting. Members must be polite and constructive when interacting with others on the forum, and when other members are flaming or flame baiting the report system must be used instead of engaging with similar responses.

> Moderators should delete any post that contains flaming or flame baiting and issue the appropriate warning. A Member Administrative Review should be created for any member who has been warned multiple times about flaming or flame baiting.

## Stolen Content

Any content shared on the forum must be shared with permission from the rights holder, either permission provided through compliance with the content's license or explicit permission provided via a Private Message or email, a copy of explicit permission must be included in the post.

By complying with the author's rights to their work we show respect to those who have dedicated their time and energy to create the things we enjoy as well as satisfying applicable laws regarding creative works. This respect ensures that we will benefit from the efforts of creative individuals now and in the future.

> Moderators should delete any post used to distribute content in whole by someone who does not have permission from the content creator and issue a Stolen Content warning. Moderators should issue a License Violation warning for any content that uses assets from an original work without permission, or if assets are used and distributed in violation of the original works license. A License Violation warning should be given with a 48 hour notice to bring the content in compliance, if the content is not brought into compliance within 48 hours the post should be deleted.

# Section Rules

The Minecraft Forum Section Rules apply to the specified section in addition to the Global Rules, where there are conflicts the Section Rules take priority over the Global Rules, meaning a section can allow (or disallow) something that is allowed (or disallowed) elsewhere on the forum.

## Minecraft Discussion

Minecraft Discussion does not permit threads advertising Minecraft Servers, visitors do not visit the Minecraft Discussion to find Minecraft Servers.

> Moderators should delete any thread made to advertise a server in any Minecraft Discussion section and issue a formal Wrong Section Servers warning. Formal warnings are used because members are usually aware it's the wrong section and make the thread anyway because of the additional exposure their server will receive.

### Suggestions

#### Constructive Replies

Replies to suggestions must be constructive criticism of the suggestion or offer ideas on how to expand the original idea, posts containing just `Support` or `No Support` are not constructive.

> Moderators should delete any post that isn't constructive, a member who is persistently making posts that aren't constructive should be issued a Spamming warning.

#### Wishlists

A wishlist is a thread with a series of unrelated suggestions, multiple items per suggestion are permitted as long as they are related, wishlists aren't allowed because they don't tend to produce constructive discussion. For example a suggestion about a gardening update featuring new plants, tools, and gardening type blocks would be allowed. However, a suggestion featuring a new dragon mob, emerald armor, and new command block commands would not be allowed.

> Moderators should lock Wishlists and reply informing the user they must create an individual thread for each suggestion.

#### Duplicate Suggestions

Suggestions should be limited to one active thread at a time, an active thread is one that has had a post made within the last month.

> Moderators should lock new threads created about an active suggestion and reply with a link to the active thread and encourage the member to expand on the idea in a reply.

### Seeds

Seeds must be for the Vanilla Minecraft game, and must be included in the opening post of the thread.

> Moderators should delete any thread that does not meet these requirements.

### Seeds

Seeds must be for the Vanilla Minecraft game, and must be included in the opening post of the thread.

> Moderators should delete any thread that does not meet these requirements.

## Servers

### Bumping

Some posts that may appear to be bumping in the Servers section are permitted:

* Encouraging members to post their Minecraft username to receive access to the server or a specific rank. This is permitted because it allows server owners to use their Minecraft Forum thread to manage applications to access their server, and communicates to visitors which servers are popular.
* Posting about a major update, information that impacts a lot of players. For example announcing a new website or significant changes to the server. Frequent changes that have limited impact, such as packages selling out or additional builds on the server are not considered major updates.

### Minecraft Server Hosts

The Minecraft Server Hosting section is a restricted section which requires an application to advertise in. The application process is outlined in the [How to advertise your Minecraft Server Host on the Minecraft Forum](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/servers/minecraft-server-hosting/2608188-how-to-advertise-your-minecraft-server-host-on-the) sticky thread in the section.

> Moderators **must not** move threads to the Minecraft Server Hosting section, any thread advertising a Minecraft Server Host made elsewhere on the forum must be deleted and an Advertising warning should be issued.

### Hijacking

Members must create their own thread to request support for the issue they're experiencing, they must not post requests for support in another members thread, this is called "Hijacking". Multiple requests for support in a single thread create confusion between the people requesting support and the people providing support.

> When a member hijacks a thread an informal warning should be issued. If the post contains enough information for support to be provided the post should be moved to a new thread in the section using the <kbd>Move</kbd> option, if the post contains no information it should be deleted.

## Show Your Creation

Show Your Creation is a section for members to share their own Minecraft related artistic works.

> Moderators should remove any content that isn't Minecraft related and issue a Friendly Rules Reminder to inform the member that any future posts in the section must be Minecraft related.

### Screenshots

#### Embed Screenshots

A collection of links is difficult to view, embedded images provide a much better user experience. Screenshots must be embedded using the `[img]` bbcode.

> Moderators should fix any posts that don't embed their screenshots and inform the member via Private Message how they can embed by providing a link to the FAQ.

### Videos

Members are permitted to post a new thread for each video they create or keep one thread updated with new videos in replies.

#### Channel Linking

The videos section is for members to share their videos, and others to find individual videos to watch. Each thread in the Videos section must contain at least one video, threads should not contain just a link to a YouTube channel.

> Moderators should remove a thread if it is just a link to a YouTube channel and a warning for Channel Linking should be issued.

### Art Shops and Requests

#### Shop Reviews

Art Shop owners aren't permitted to post reviews of other shops or comments about the quality of the shop because this can create a hostile environment and cause arguments amongst members.

> Moderators should remove reviews posted by other Art Shop owners, if the review is inflammatory then a warning for Flame Baiting should be issued, otherwise a warning for Spamming should be issued.
